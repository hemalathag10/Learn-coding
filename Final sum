Problem
Chef has an array A of length N. In one operation, Chef can:
•	Choose any subarray [�,�][L,R] (1≤�≤�≤�)(1≤L≤R≤N);
•	Add 11 to ��AL, subtract 11 from ��+1AL+1, add 11 to ��+2AL+2, subtract 11 from ��+3AL+3 and so on, till ��AR.
Chef performed �Q such operations where the ��ℎith operation was performed on the subarray [��,��][Li,Ri].
Determine the final sum of the array after these �Q operations.
Note that a subarray is formed by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.
Input Format
•	The first line of input will contain a single integer �T, denoting the number of test cases.
•	Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
o	The first line of each test case contains two integers �,�N,Q, number of elements and the number of queries.
o	The next line contains �N space-separated integers �1,�2,…��A1,A2,…AN - denoting the array �A.
o	The next �Q lines contains two space-separated integers with ��ℎith line containing ��,��Li,Ri.
Output Format
For each test case, output the final sum of the array after performing all the �Q operations.
Constraints
•	1≤�≤10001≤T≤1000
•	1≤�,�≤3⋅1051≤N,Q≤3⋅105
•	1≤��≤1001≤Ai≤100
•	The sum of �N over all test cases won't exceed 3⋅1053⋅105.

Explanation:
Test case 11: The queries are as follows:
•	Query 11: The chosen subarray is [1,3,4,4,2][1,3,4,4,2] which changes to [1+1,3−1,4+1,4−1,2+1]=[2,2,5,3,3][1+1,3−1,4+1,4−1,2+1]=[2,2,5,3,3]. Thus, the array becomes [2,2,5,3,3][2,2,5,3,3].
•	Query 22: The chosen subarray is [5,3][5,3] which changes to [5+1,3−1]=[6,2][5+1,3−1]=[6,2]. Thus, the array becomes [2,2,6,2,3][2,2,6,2,3].
•	Query 33: The chosen subarray is [2][2] which changes to [2+1]=[3][2+1]=[3]. Thus, the array becomes [2,3,6,2,3][2,3,6,2,3].
The sum of final array is 2+3+6+2+3=162+3+6+2+3=16.
Test case 22: The queries are as follows:
•	Query 11: The chosen subarray is [4][4] which changes to [4+1]=[5][4+1]=[5]. Thus, the array becomes [5][5].
•	Query 22: The chosen subarray is [5][5] which changes to [5+1]=[6][5+1]=[6]. Thus, the array becomes [6][6].
The sum of final array is 66.
