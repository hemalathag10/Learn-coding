Given an array, the task is to find the difference between highest occurrence and lowest occurrence of any number in an array.
Note: If only one type of element is present in the array return 0.
 

Example 1:

Input:
arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
Output:
1
Explanation:
Lowest occurring element (1) occurs once.
Highest occurring element (2) occurs 2 times

        #Code here
        c=Counter(a)
        freq=c.values()
        h=int(max(freq))
        l=int(min(freq))
        return h-l
